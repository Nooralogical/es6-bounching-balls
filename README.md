# es6-bubble-generator

## About
This is a ECMAScript 6 and HTML5 canvas practise. Aim is to demostrate the capabilites of ES6 compared basic JavaScript and practise using the features in an efficient way.

The final result is a bubble generator with multiple bubbles moving in different directions with varying speeds. These can be modified by small changes in the source code.

## Demo 

This is the [demo](http://niisku.lamk.fi/~Noora16008/demos/bubbles/) for a working bubble generator. Click one bubble and check the console for the bubble coordinates.
